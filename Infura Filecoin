Securing Your Credentials
The Filecoin endpoint currently supports basic auth which requires passing in a username and password.

The username is your `Project ID` and password is your `Project Secret` which you can find by navigating to your project settings at `https://infura.io/dashboard/filecoin//settings`

Stateless and Streaming APIs
Most RPC methods are stateless and are made available through HTTPS. These can be queried with curl:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  --user <PROJECT_ID>:<PROJECT_SECRET>
  --url https://filecoin.infura.io
  --data '{ "id": 0, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "Filecoin.ChainHead", "params": [] }'
Methods that are designed to stream updates to the client are available only through Websockets.

wscat can be used to try these from CLI.

wscat --auth <PROJECT_ID>:<PROJECT_SECRET> --connect wss://filecoin.infura.io

> { "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "Filecoin.ChainNotify", "params": [], "id": 3 }
